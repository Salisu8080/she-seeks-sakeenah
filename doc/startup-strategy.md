## 📞 Questions for You, Maymunah

Before finalizing this strategy, I have a few more questions:

1. **Sakeenah AI**: Would you prefer the bot on Telegram or WhatsApp? (WhatsApp has broader reach in Nigeria but is harder to build bots for)

2. **Pricing validation**: Have you tested pricing with your 70 members? Would ₦3,000 feel accessible?

3. **Content partnerships**: Do you have relationships with any Islamic scholars or ustadhas who could validate content?

4. **Physical events**: Which city would you launch the first retreat in? Lagos, Abuja, Kano?

5. **Time commitment**: How many hours/week can you dedicate to this right now?
