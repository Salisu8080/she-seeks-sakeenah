She Seeks Sakeenah: Full Presentation Script (Founder's Delivery – Detailed Talk Version)


---

INTRODUCTION
Assalamu Alaikum wa rahmatullah.
My name is Maymunah Muhammad. I’m the founder of She Seeks Sakeenah — a faith-first wellness ecosystem for Muslim women. I’m also a content strategist and a prompt engineer-in-training. I built this because I saw a dangerous pattern: Muslim women seeking healing are constantly being forced to compromise their values.

We’re entering therapy spaces, fitness programs, and online communities that either misunderstand or outright oppose our Islam. There is no mainstream solution built for the Muslim woman’s emotional, physical, and spiritual alignment.

So instead of waiting for the world to accommodate us, I decided to build something unapologetically ours.


---

1. THE PROBLEM: When Healing Means Compromise The modern wellness industry promotes freedom, expression, empowerment — but at the cost of our īmān. Muslim women are told:

"Let go of guilt," even if that guilt is from sin

"Empower yourself," but only by detaching from submission

"Love your body," but only by exposing it

"Manifest peace," but never through duʿāʾ, tawakkul, or dhikr


And that’s where the exhaustion comes in. Because she wants to feel better — but without feeling like she’s losing herself.

In Nigeria alone, over 45 million Muslim women face this tension. And yet there is no dominant, deen-first wellness platform made for her. This is an underserved, unprotected, and untapped space.


---

2. THE SOLUTION: She Seeks Sakeenah She Seeks Sakeenah is not just another wellness brand with a hijabi-friendly filter. It’s a return. A return to īmān-centered healing. A return to tools and routines that align her with Allah — spiritually, emotionally, and physically.

We are creating a layered ecosystem:

Taalim-based wellness circles where Muslim women gather to learn, reflect, and grow

AI-personalized tools — like journals and fitness routines designed using prompt engineering

Reflection spaces, book cycles, and sisterhood support groups

Eventually, a mobile app with a digital coach — Sakeenah AI — that serves as a companion for her wellness journey


And everything we offer — from journaling prompts to fitness — is rooted in Qur’an, Sunnah, and feminine balance.


---

3. WHO WE SERVE: Psychographics + Demographics Our women are:

Ages 16–35, primarily in urban and semi-urban Nigeria

Faith-driven but emotionally overwhelmed

Burnt out by Western wellness and overexposure culture

Looking for safe, spiritually-aligned tools

Digitally active and values-oriented


We’re also building outreach systems for rural Muslim women, through masjid partnerships and Islamiyya ambassadors — so no one is left behind.


---

4. MARKET OPPORTUNITY: The Market Is Starving We’re not talking about a small niche. We’re talking about:

45 million+ Muslim women in Nigeria alone (Pew, 2022)

A global surge in Islamic mental health searches

A documented rise in Muslim Gen Z and millennial women reclaiming their faith

A global wellness industry worth $4.5 trillion — and virtually no major Islamic female-led stake in it


No one is owning this space — especially not in West Africa. And Muslim women are actively searching, asking, and yearning for something that finally centers them.


---

5. BUSINESS MODEL: Free Core + Value Ecosystem We’re not here to extract — we’re here to build something that earns trust and then earns revenue.

Free Core:

Monthly taalim circles

Sisterhood support groups

---

Testable & lean: Launching low-tech using Canva, ChatGPT, Notion, Telegram

Community-first: Building emotional bonds before asking for money

AI-integrated: Using prompt engineering to design journals, workouts, affirmations, spiritual kits

Paced for longevity: No burnout, no overbuilding


It’s already happening — sisters are responding, journaling, reflecting. This isn’t a prototype. It’s movement in motion.

10. CLOSING She Seeks Sakeenah isn’t a business that grew from ambition. It’s a movement born from pain and clarity.

We’re not creating more noise. We’re building a system of stillness. We’re not asking her to compromise. We’re teaching her how to return.

This is a platform. This is a sisterhood. This is a spiritual revolution — wrapped in soft routines, AI smarts, and barakah-based planning.

Join us. Fund us. Partner with us. Let’s restore sakeenah — together, through īmān.

Jazakum Allahu khayran.
